"Emergency distributed hydropower for Zambezi Basin: 200 venturi modules (€36M, 18 months) + AI-enforced democratic governance to prevent Kariba-style elite capture." Visibility: Public (critical—private repos are useless for activism)
# Zambia Emergency Hydropower: 200 Modules, €36M, 18 Months

**Problem**: Kariba Dam at 5.7% capacity causes 21-hour blackouts, famine for 1.8M Zambians.  
**Solution**: Distributed submerged venturi turbines—no dams, no debt, no elite capture.  
**Governance**: Harmonie AI-enforced stakeholder council (4-level, 80% approval threshold).

## Download & Build It Yourself

- **CAD**: FreeCAD files—cut steel locally, bolt assembly (no welding)
- **Cost**: €4,785 per 10 kW module (full BOM in `/Data/`)
- **Timeline**: 2 days installation per module
- **Governance**: Read `Governance/17_Articles_Zambezi.md`

## How It Works

**Technical**: Submerged venturi duct accelerates natural river flow (Bernoulli's principle), generating 10 kW per module at 1.5m head.  
**Governance**: The Zambezi Basin Council gives 30% seats to upstream farmers, 30% to downstream communities (with ecological veto), preventing the elite capture that destroyed Kariba.
